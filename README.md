# smiley-recognition

This is a small project about a machine learning model that can recognize four different kinds of smileys drawn on an 28x28 grid.

# data generation

The image date that gets fed to the model later is created by chosing random components to create a smiley face. More specifically each generated image consists of a mouth, a left eye, a right eye and sometimes a nose. The parts are chosen from the images stored in data\test-data-source or data\train-data-source. The test images are created from a different source than the training data to get a better approximation on how good the model really works.
